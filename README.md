## CFC Section 580
Section 580 detects, alerts of, and responds to players who maliciously use net messages to harm a server.
Configuration is currently done from within the code, but will eventually be Convars.

Section 580 completely overwrites `net.Incoming` (vs. wrapping!) on the serverside, so if you have any other addons that do this, they won't play nicely.

This addon aims to be as performant and useful as possible. An emphasis has been placed on efficiency and simplicity.

Moonscript was chosen because GLua kind of sucks and Moonscript makes writing new addons tolerable. We provide auto-compiled code for you, so you can still run this without issue on your server.
